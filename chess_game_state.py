"""This file contains the code necessary to keep track the state of the board at any given turn. The board is
represented # by a 2D list. Each piece is represented by a piece 'code' (eg. BQ = Black Queen), while '~~' stands for
an empty square. The rules for each piece are imported from the chess_pieces module and assigned as values to each
piece code. The get_piece() and make_move() methods can be called in the main function to modify the GameState list.
The rules for check, castling etc. will also be stored here."""
