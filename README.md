# Chess
## Summary 
This is the first stage of a long term project to create a chess engine using Python. As much as the programme as possible will be written from scratch (e.g. not using 
existing Python chess modules). So far, only the Pygame module is being used in the code in order to help handle graphics and user input. The point of the 
project is to put everything I have learnt about Python up to this point to the test, and to learn more about algorithms and ML as we progress further into
the project. Our initial goal will be to create a 2000 ELO strength engine. But, before we get to that stage, we'll have to start by making a 
working chess game in Python.
